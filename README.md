# Marketing Pricing Project

A leading supermarket chain in Portugal of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga regularly partners with suppliers to fund promotions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions.  While a majority of its promotion activities are in-store promotions, it recently started partnering with select suppliers to experiment on personalized promotions.  In theory, personalized promotions are more efficient as offers are only made to targeted individuals who required an offer to purchase a product.  In contrast, most in-store promotions make temporary price reductions on a product available to all customers whether or not a customer needs the incentive to purchase the product.  The efficiency of personalized promotion comes from an additional analysis required on customer transaction data to determine which customers are most likely to purchase a product to be offered in order to maximize the opportunity for incremental sales and profits.


## Problem

Your analytics consulting firm was selected by Pernalonga (the client) to adjust shelf prices to improve revenue.  While Pernalonga understands the benefits of data and analytics-driven decision making, it is constrained in resources to implement price changes to take effect in stores in the week of April 1-7, 2108 due to holidays in the week immediately preceding.  Specifically, it can only make price changes to the same 100 products across 2 categories (fresh products excluded) in 10 stores.  As supplier-funded in-store temporary price reductions on products are still being negotiated, you can assume the same promotion schedule as the same week in 2017, i.e., timing and product temporary price reduction levels are the same for corresponding weeks in 2017 and 2018.  You have two weeks to analyze the data and recommend price changes that will improve Pernalonga's expected revenue while maintaining overall profitability.

Your pricing model should at least consider the following factors:

- shelf price
- promoted price
- product affinity: substitutes and complements
- sales seasonality
Your price change recommendations should be realistic, reasonable and justified with price elasticity measures.  Minimum requirements:

**a list of 100 products with recommend price changes and justifications
expected changes in sales quantity, revenue and profitability for each store and overall across 10 stores
Since the problem is on changing shelf prices, it is not necessary to analyze data in the customer dimension, but bonus points will be given if effects of recommended price changes on each customer segment's sales quantity, revenue and profitability are reported.**
