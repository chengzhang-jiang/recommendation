# Marketing Recommendation Project

A leading supermarket chain in Portugal of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga regularly partners with suppliers to fund promotions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions.  While a majority of its promotion activities are in-store promotions, it recently started partnering with select suppliers to experiment on personalized promotions.  In theory, personalized promotions are more efficient as offers are only made to targeted individuals who required an offer to purchase a product.  In contrast, most in-store promotions make temporary price reductions on a product available to all customers whether or not a customer needs the incentive to purchase the product.  The efficiency of personalized promotion comes from an additional analysis required on customer transaction data to determine which customers are most likely to purchase a product to be offered in order to maximize the opportunity for incremental sales and profits.
